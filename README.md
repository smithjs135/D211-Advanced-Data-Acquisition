# Hospital Readmissions Predictor: Project Overview
  ## Hospital Data
  
* Created a tool that displays associations with hospital readmission rates
* The census dataset “acs2015countydata.csv” (Muonneutrino, 2019), was used in combination with the medical dataset for this analysis, see attached. Both datasets are scoped nationally for the year 2015. City and state attributes are common in both datasets and were used in the join condition. The census data attributes that are used in my analysis consist of:
•	Asian Alone - Numeric
•	Black Alone - Numeric
•	Hispanic or Latino Alone - Numeric
•	Native Hawaiian Alone - Numeric
•	White Alone - Numeric
